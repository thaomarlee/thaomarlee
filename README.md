<h1>Hi, I'm Marlee!                           
<br/>An aspiring Data Analyst from Charlotte, NC.
 <br/></h1>

 <br/></h1>In my journey as a budding data analyst, I am guided by a set of core values that drive my work ethic, 
decision-making, and interactions with data. 
I believe the power of data-driven insights can help to unlock opportunities, solve complex problems, and make a meaningful impact.
 I value Integrity and accuracy so I approach every analysis with a commitment to honesty, transparency, and attention to detail. 
Collaboration and continuous learning are essential to me therefore I thrive in environments where diverse perspectives are valued. 
I am actively seeking opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge. 
Above all, I am passionate about leveraging data to empower decision-making, inform strategy, 
and drive positive change in organizations and communities. <br/></h1>
